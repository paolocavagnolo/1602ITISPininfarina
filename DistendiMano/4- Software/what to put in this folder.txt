put here any software you wrote. please remember that a code become much simplier if properly commented. instead of add too many instructions here on how to set and change the code, take your time to properly comment the code.

the code can be written basically the way you want but we strongly suggest to use something widely known and accessible
- arduino
- processing
- python
- etc.
