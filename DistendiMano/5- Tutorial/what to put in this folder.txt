add here all the information needed to modify the files, make the parts, assemble them together, test the product and properly use it

no projects are perfect, it's good to add all the known bugs and what are you going to do

we hope other peoples will modify and make new, personalized versions of this project. please help them to make the documentation as well.
use where possible opensource softwares to write your documentation, this will make it editable easily:
- libreoffice
- scribus

where not possible, accessible formats, like TXT or RTF
if not possible, something that everybody can read like PDF
in alternative something free to use like google docs
keep in mind that *.doc\*.docx  *.ppt\*.pptx *.xls\*.xlsx are readable with not microsoft software as well, but not so easily
